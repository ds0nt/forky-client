# Bubbles

Bubbles is a free and open source mind-mapping platform. It is a web-integrated visualization platform that is meant to complement and communicate with other collaborative tools, such as evernote, and calendars. 

This is the browser app code that connects to [bubbles-server](http://github.com/21cdawn/bubbles-server). Please feel free to make use of the algorithms and code as you see fit, or suggest improvements.

## Bubbles is in Development

I am but a single coder. Take a look at bubbles.vintauri.io, play around, imagine, and then send me an email and I'll put you to work!! :p

This platform needs marketting, more basic features, more sharing powers, and more integration! As well as a robust back-end.
